This dashoboard shows a table of users with their own working hours. It was built with  angularjs + angular material
## Local Environment
To run locally, using gulp and node, follow the steps after opening terminal:
  1. Clone this repository.
  2. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and Gulp (`npm install -g gulp`) installed on your machine. I used version 6x and 3x respectively.
  3. Run `npm install` to get all dependencies like AngularJS, Angular Material and so many others.
  4. Run `gulp`. A web browser window/tab should be opened with a localhost. (**Preferably, Chrome**)
